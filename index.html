				        <p>"I had the opportunity to work with Kevin Chu for several months from October 2014-
April 2015 as my personal trainer and coach. I found Kevin to be an excellent teacher â€“ he
explained exercises clearly, checked my understanding and memory from session to session, and
patiently reinforced learning. He was consistently supportive and encouraging. The behavioural
psychology approaches that he employed were very helpful. He recognized the difficulty that
older persons have in establishing a new behaviour pattern and found opportunities to
compliment me on incremental (sometimes pretty minimal) progress. From my experience as a medical educator
and physician, I think that Kevin has the potential to be an outstanding health professional who
will be able to apply his skills and experience in kinesiology."</p>
